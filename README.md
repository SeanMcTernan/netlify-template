# Netlify Template

Hello world!

## Deployment

### Netlify

Use the button below to build and deploy your own copy of the repository:

<a href="https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/mpexm/netlify-template"><img src="https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg" alt="Deploy to Netlify"></a>

After clicking that button, youâ€™ll authenticate with GitHub and choose a repository name. 
Netlify will then automatically create a repository in your GitHub account with a copy of the files from the template. 
Next, it will build and deploy the new site on Netlify.
